  This pipeline provides a workflow for processing and analyzing bulk RNAseq data
  following the mthos described in https//www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/training/RNASeq_Course/Analysing%20RNA-Seq%20data%20Exercise.pdf

  The workflow consists of the following processing steps:
  * run initial quality control on reads in a bulk RNAseq sample
  * trim adapter sequences from the reads
  * align the reads to a reference genome
  * produce a comprehensive quality control (QC) report.

  More specifically it uses the following programs:
  * FASTQC: Perform QC on the read data before trimming using FastQC
  * TRIM_GALORE: Trim adapter sequences and perform QC after trimming using Trim Galore (bundles Cutadapt and FastQC)
  * HISAT2_ALIGN: Align reads to the reference genome using Hisat2
  * MULTIQC: Generate a comprehensive QC report using MultiQC
